### About Me
I recently graduated with my Master's in Economics from the University of Alberta where I took standard theory courses in Micro and Macro economics, econometrics 1 and 2 and elective courses in data analysis, 
machine learning and forecasting and labour and international economics. I am currently working as an economic researcher with the Alberta Centre for Labour Market Research where I am studying the economic impacts of major natural resource projects on local labour markets. I am very interested in using machine learning methods for causal inference, such as the double machine learning (DML) framework and I applied causalforests in my research. 

Outside of my work I enjoy strength training, playing sports and outdoor activities like hiking and skiing. As a former Usports athlete I enjoy competing and pushing myself physically! I am currently looking for roles in data science as well as roles in government and private consulting!

### Work Experience
**Economic Researcher — Alberta Centre for Labour Market Research (ACLMR)**  
- Developed reproducible data pipelines in Python, R, and SQL to clean, merge, and structure large geospatial, census, and project-level datasets for statistical modelling.  
- Applied machine learning algorithms (e.g., Causal Forests) to build predictive models and estimate heterogeneous treatment effects across more than 50 outcomes.  
- Collaborated with Statistics Canada and Natural Resources Canada to obtain and interpret specialized datasets.  
- Presented analytical findings to technical and non-technical audiences.

### Projects
**Forecasting Unemployment using ARIMA and Neural Network Auto Regression (NNAR)**  
[View Project Report](projects/Forecasting_project.html)
[Github Repository](https://github.com/LukeHarold11/Forecasting_project)
- Developed a rolling-window Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR) model in R to forecast unemployment under seasonal and structural shifts and compared performance to ARIMA models.  
- Found that the NNAR model had the best accuracy overall and during the COVID period.
